The suspension was heavily re-tuned with a larger front sway bar, new rear sway bar, increased rear roll center height, adjusted spring rates, and a new steering gear that improved handling. Visual updates included new halogen projector headlamps with LED accents. The interior received major refreshments with new seats, softer-touch surfaces, extra sound insulation, acoustic glass, and new LED ambient lighting and center console. The powertrain was eventually standardized to the 3.6L Pentastar V6 producing 283 HP paired with a six-speed automatic transmission.
